## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Git (for version control)
- Virtual environment tool (venv, conda, etc.)

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd python_ai_ml_kaggle

# Make scripts executable (Unix/Mac only)
chmod +x setup_env.sh activate.sh
```

### 2. Environment Setup

**For Unix/Mac:**

```bash
# Set up virtual environment and dependencies
./setup_env.sh

# Activate the environment
source activate.sh
```

**For Windows Command Prompt:**

```cmd
# Set up environment
setup_env_windows.bat
```

**For Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
# Set up environment
.\setup_env_windows.ps1
```

### 3. Verify Installation

```bash
# Install/upgrade dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the main application to verify setup
python src/main.py
```

### 4. Start Your Competition

1. Download competition data to `data/raw/`
2. Create initial EDA notebook in `notebooks/`
3. Begin feature engineering in `src/features/`
4. Develop models using `src/models/`
